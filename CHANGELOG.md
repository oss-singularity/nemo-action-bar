- Add automated repository checks and refresh the public project presentation.

- Keep root, favorite and archive actions available but hide them by default.

  clipboard action.
- Traverse Nemo's widget/action tree without dropping submenu branches when
  short-lived Python wrapper IDs are reused.
- Handle Nemo's lazily refreshed action sensitivity while keeping selection
  checks and confirmation dialogs under Nemo's control.

- Add a declaratively configured, live-reloading Nemo action bar.
